Do I want to allow `functions` in a class?  
Do I want to force them to be in a `"companion namespace"`?  

How will traits work that want to define `methods` and `functions`?  

Do I want to allow static variables?

If an instance variable is private, and an inheriting class re-define a variable of that name?  
I would think it wouldnt affect anything.  
Also, how about instance variables defined by traits? (private / protected / public)  

Project-wide re-extensions?
